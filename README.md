    - costumer_analysis.ipynb: the Exploratory Data Analysis that enables us to study the costumer behaviour
    - messages.ipynb: segment the clients in groups and generate messages with gpt-4o-mini based on their features
    - test_functions.ipynb: unit testing of the functions developed
- results: containes a txt file with the messages generated and the histograms generated
- src: python files with the functions needed

## Results

Through the histograms we get to know the consumer profiles. For example, it is possible to see the distribution of the Age of our clients, as well as the age of the clients that purchased and did not purchase our product.
